CASI provides the datasets from Efron & Hastie, _Computer Age Statistical Inference_ in an accessible R format
for those who want to use them for study or to try to reproduce analyses from the book.
They were downloaded from Trevor Hastie's web site, http://hastie.su.domains/CASI_files/DATA/,
but quite a few files were messy and required some processing to make into R datasets.
